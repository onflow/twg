The governance of the TWG prioritizes fairness, transparency, and accountability through the following measures:

•	*Tenets*: The TWG prioritizes inclusivity, transparency, accountability, innovation, and decentralization.
•	*Membership*: The TWG is open to all, allowing representatives from the Flow Foundation, developers, researchers, community members, and industry experts to nominate experts for membership.
•	*Roles and Responsibilities*: Clear definitions and communication of areas of responsibility, key tasks, timelines, and deliverables ensure accountability and transparency.
•	*Decision-making*: Consensus-based decision-making with equal voting rights for all members ensures democratic decision-making.
•	*Meetings*: Regular meetings provide a platform for progress discussions, idea sharing, and decision-making, open to all members.
•	*Documentation*: All decisions, discussions, and outcomes are documented, with meeting minutes, decision logs, and progress reports shared openly for public view and commentary.
•	*Review and Evaluation*: Periodic reviews and evaluations, including community feedback, ensure the TWG's objectives are being met.

### Roles & Responsibilities

The TWG is responsible for analyzing challenges, designing innovative solutions, and engaging and educating the community. Key responsibilities include:

•	Analyzing: Conducting data analysis on Flow blockchain, gathering user surveys, and incorporating community feedback to identify key problem areas in Flow token economics.

### Meeting Schedule & Decisions

The latest meeting details, including minutes (discussion points) and video recordings, are available [here], for those interested in following the progress and trajectory of Flow Tokenomics.

### TWG Priorities (TBD)

The TWG's focus would be on developing innovative solutions to address the most pressing challenges in the Flow blockchain ecosystem, such as:

•	State Bloating: Developing economic solutions to address state bloat, such as revising minimum balance requirements and revisiting storage-related incentives.
•	Low Network Fees: Developing strategies to increase network fees and exploring new use cases that require higher fees.
•	High Token Inflation: Implementing strategies to reduce token inflation.
•	Minimum Staking Requirements: Evaluating and adjusting minimum staking requirements to enhance decentralization and network security.
•	Decentralization of Consensus: Promoting decentralization of consensus through increased node distribution.
•	Competitive Yields for Nodes: Developing strategies to promote competitive yields for nodes.

### Last Word

The Flow Tokenomics Working Group (TWG) plays a crucial role in advancing the economic design of Flow's native token, FLOW, while promoting network security, decentralization, and overall value proposition. Through the expertise of its diverse team and collaborative approach, the TWG makes valuable contributions to the Flow ecosystem. Continual refinement and optimization of the FLOW token's economic model by the TWG would pave the way for the widespread adoption of Web3 experiences by mainstream users.
